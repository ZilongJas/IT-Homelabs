# Small Network Setup Homelab Summary:

This homelab covers configuring and managing network routers and protocols within a simulated environment in packet tracer.

  - **Router Configuration**: Setting up basic network topology and configuring routers. 
  - **Static Routing**: Implementing static routes to ensure direct communication between networks.  
  - **RIP**: Setting up and managing RIP for basic dynamic routing.  
  - **OSPF**: Configuring OSPF for scalable and efficient dynamic routing.  
  - **EIGRP**: Implementing EIGRP for advanced and optimized routing within complex networks.
