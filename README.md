- ## Troubleshooting IP Cameras (PLANNED)
  - We have 4 IP cameras installed in our home but they stopped working.
  - The problem is that it is not displaying inside the live app using our public ip address, but will display after plugging in a hdmi cable to a monitor connected to the NVR.
  - PoE based (?), need to double check, but cable shouldnt be the problem since the 4 display works, just not wirelessly via app
  - I assume the problem is the camera's private IP addresses have to be manually configured, need to configure DHCP (potential solution) 
  - might need to assign port forwarding to each camera (potential solution) 
  - Need to configure auto backup and auto clean up storage when full (avoid future problems)
  - Need to check on it after obtaining N+
